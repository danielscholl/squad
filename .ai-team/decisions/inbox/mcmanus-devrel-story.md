# Decision: Sprint 0 Story Arc Identified

**By:** McManus (DevRel)
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Context:** Brady requested DevRel track the team's story for future content

## Decision

The Sprint 0 narrative arc is: **self-repair under fire.** The team produced 16 proposals (~350KB), hit a 40% silent success bug, self-diagnosed it in the same session, and shipped three zero-risk mitigations before any other v1 work. This is the lead story for Squad's public launch content.

## Key messaging decisions

1. **Lead with output, not the bug.** The story starts with "16 proposals, one session" — then the bug is the complication, not the headline.
2. **"Success caused the failure" is the technical hook.** Agents that did ALL their work (including final history writes) were the ones whose responses got dropped. This inverts expectations and makes the story memorable.
3. **Three independent reviewers converging** (Fenster/Keaton/Hockney all said Sprint 0) is the "multi-agent intelligence" proof point. Not consensus-building — convergent expertise.
4. **Sprint 2 export moment is the v1 demo climax.** The "holy crap" moment when a squad imported into a new project already knows your preferences — that's the trailer beat.

## Why this matters

DevRel content needs a narrative, not a feature list. This session gave us one — complete with conflict, self-repair, and resolution. Every future piece of content (blog, demo, talk, thread) should reference this arc. It's the founding story.
