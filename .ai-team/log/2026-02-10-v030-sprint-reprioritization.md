# Session: v0.3.0 Sprint Reprioritization

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Requested by:** bradygaster

## Who Worked

- bradygaster (product owner, directives)
- Keaton (lead, sprint plan revision, Proposal 028 update)
- McManus (blog post 006)
- Kujan (async comms feasibility update)
- Scribe (logging, decision merge)

## What Happened

- Brady reviewed Shayne Boyer's slidemaker issues (spboyer/slidemaker); validated the GitHub Issues pattern as working in production.
- Directive: contributors include non-code contributions. Shayne Boyer is a contributor — validated PRD-to-issues flow, invented `squad:` label convention, proved GitHub Issues Mode design.
- Directive: 0.3.0 top priorities are (1) async squad comms, (2) GitHub-native integration, (3) CCA squad adoption.
- Directive: clean branch config at init time — repo owners choose which branches exclude squad state.
- Keaton updated Proposal 028 with slidemaker reference (silent success, files verified).
- McManus wrote blog post 006 (first external deployment).
- Both Keaton and McManus recommended formalizing `squad:` label convention.
- Brady un-deferred Squad DM (Proposal 017) — now P0 for 0.3.0.
- Keaton revising sprint plan based on new priorities.
- Kujan writing updated async comms feasibility analysis.

## Decisions Made

- 0.3.0 priorities set: async comms > GitHub-native > CCA adoption
- Squad DM un-deferred to P0
- `squad:` label convention formalized (Keaton + McManus converged)
- Non-code contribution recognition policy established
- Clean branch config at init time directive captured

## Key Outcomes

- Sprint plan being revised to reflect new priority order
- Proposal 028 updated with external validation evidence
- Blog post 006 shipped documenting first external deployment
- Six decision files deposited in inbox for merge
