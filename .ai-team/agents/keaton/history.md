# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial architecture review and proposal-first design (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **Squad uses distributed context windows** — coordinator at ~1.5% overhead, veteran agents at ~4.4%, leaving 94% for reasoning. This inverts the traditional multi-agent context bloat problem.
- **Architecture patterns**: drop-box for concurrent writes (inbox → Scribe merge), parallel fan-out by default (multiple `task` calls in one turn), casting system for persistent character names, memory compounding via per-agent `history.md`.
- **Proposal-first workflow governs all meaningful changes** — required sections (Problem → Solution → Trade-offs → Alternatives → Success Criteria) force complete thinking. 48-hour review timeline. Cancelled proposals kept as learning artifacts.
- **Key trade-offs**: coordinator complexity (32KB) is a maintenance surface; parallel execution depends on agents following shared memory protocols; casting adds personality at the cost of init complexity.
- **Compound decisions are the strategic model** — each feature makes the next easier. Proposals are the alignment mechanism that makes this possible.

## Learnings

- **2026-02-10: Model Selection Proposal Consolidation (024 + 024a + 024b → 024)**
  - **Consolidated three documents into one:** Brady asked for "a spec/proposal for it" — singular. Three separate docs (draft, catalog, algorithm) created review friction. Merged into a single authoritative 024 with 024a/024b as companion reference material.
  - **What I kept from 024 (Verbal's original draft):** Problem statement (unchanged — still correct), charter template concept, registry integration, delegation support patterns, trade-offs framework. The original design was structurally sound; it just needed the catalog and fallback work integrated.
  - **What I kept from 024a (Kujan's catalog):** The full 16-model catalog, but condensed to 4 essential columns (Model ID, Provider, Tier, Best Fit) instead of the 8-dimension analysis. The detailed dimensions remain in 024a as reference for implementers. Role-to-model mapping expanded from 8 to 11 roles. Default-per-tier recommendations (Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.5/Haiku 4.5) replacing the old Sonnet 4-centric defaults.
  - **What I kept from 024b (Verbal's algorithm):** The entire algorithm — 4-layer selection priority, task complexity overrides, provider diversity triggers, fallback chains by tier, 3-retry max, silent-by-default behavior, nuclear fallback. Also the ready-to-paste coordinator prompt section and charter template with Fallback field. This was the most operationally complete document and its content went in nearly verbatim.
  - **What I cut:** 024's original 3-model design (superseded by catalog), verbose cross-vendor section (folded into catalog table), user-facing documentation section (deferred — Wave 2 item 5.3 covers spawn output, full roster display is Phase 3), alternatives considered (good thinking but not needed in a consolidated approved spec), the 8-dimension analysis from 024a (stays in companion doc — too detailed for the spec).
  - **What I restructured:** Moved fallback resilience to its own top-level section (was buried in 024b §3) because Brady flagged it as the most important part. Added implementation plan referencing sprint plan items 4.1–4.4. Added success criteria for fallback behavior ("no user-facing error when any single model or provider is unavailable"). Updated default model from Sonnet 4 to Sonnet 4.5 throughout (024 was written before the catalog existed).
  - **Key decision:** Status changed from "Draft — Deferred to Horizon" to "Approved ✅". This is no longer a future idea — it's a v0.3.0 Wave 1 deliverable with assigned owners and effort estimates.

- **2026-02-10: v0.3.0 Sprint Plan Decisions (Proposal 027)**
  - **Prioritized per-agent model selection (024 Phases 1-2):** Highest-compound feature available. It improves every future agent spawn — Redfoot gets vision on Opus, Scribe gets speed on Haiku, Hockney gets fast test gen. Zero-config via auto-selection algorithm. Phase 1 is coordinator prompt only (zero code risk), Phase 2 adds charter + registry integration. Deferred Phase 3 (cost reporting, override persistence) — polish, not leverage.
  - **Prioritized team backlog / message extraction (023 Phases 1-2):** Brady's "favorite part." Closes the biggest information loss — multi-item messages lose 2 of 3 items today. Dual-layer storage (SQL hot + filesystem durable) is elegant and uses proven patterns. Creates Squad's third memory channel (intent). Deferred agent cloning (Phase 3) and proactive surfacing (Phase 4) — too much coordination complexity before capture is proven.
  - **Prioritized Demo 1 scripted infrastructure (026 partial):** Brady needs to show Squad to the world. One perfect demo beats five drafts. vhs tape files enable automated GIF generation and CI verification. Deferred Demos 2-5 until Demo 1 format is validated.
  - **Cut aggressively:** No Squad DM (second product surface), no agent-to-agent negotiation (premature), no speculative execution (needs lower silent success rate), no Squad Paper (content, not product), no model cost reporting (polish). v0.3.0 is intentionally 28-39h vs v0.2.0's 55-71h. Fewer items, done right.
  - **Two waves, not three:** Wave 1 (Intelligence) ships model selection + backlog capture. Wave 2 (Integration) connects them — Scribe merge, agent read access, model visibility, demo infrastructure. Smaller wave count means faster iteration and less gate overhead.
  - **Key insight:** v0.2.0 gave Squad hands (export, import, skills, tiered modes). v0.3.0 gives it a brain (right models, persistent intent, visible reasoning). The compound strategy is working — each version's features make the next version's features cheaper to build.

- **2026-02-10: GitHub-Native Team Planning (Proposal 028)**
  - **What I designed:** A four-phase plan to make Squad's internal planning artifacts (proposals, backlog items) visible on GitHub as Issues and Project boards. Phase 1 (one-way push, 3-4h) creates GitHub Issues when agents write proposals or capture backlog items. Phase 2 adds comment pull-back — human comments on issues flow into agent context. Phase 3 adds full GitHub Project board sync with column management. Phase 4 is aspirational cross-repo aggregation.
  - **Key architectural decision: filesystem remains authoritative, GitHub is a synchronized view.** Evaluated three options — filesystem-auth (Option A), GitHub-auth (Option B), and true bidirectional sync (Option C). Chose Option A because it preserves Squad's core strengths: agents read files not APIs, offline mode works, git history is the audit trail, and zero external dependencies for core operation. Option B would make Squad dependent on GitHub API availability. Option C is a product in itself (bidirectional sync is what Notion/Obsidian spend entire teams on). This extends Proposal 023's principle: "filesystem always wins, SQL is a queryable cache" → "filesystem always wins, GitHub is a collaboration cache."
  - **Shayne's door matters.** PR #2's GitHub Issues Mode points outward (work external issues). This proposal turns it inward (push internal planning to GitHub). Same `gh` CLI / MCP tools, different direction. The reuse is intentional — no new dependencies, no new patterns, just a new application of proven ones.
  - **Scoped out of v0.3.0 deliberately.** Phase 1 needs Proposal 023's backlog.md to exist first (shipping in v0.3.0). Phase 1 is the obvious v0.4.0 centerpiece — high value (80% of the vision), low risk (3-4h prompt engineering, no index.js changes), and it compounds with proactive backlog surfacing (also deferred to v0.4.0).
  - **Explicit scope boundary:** Only proposals and backlog items sync to GitHub. Decisions, history, skills, and charters stay filesystem-only. Without this boundary, scope gravity pulls everything into the sync surface and Squad becomes a sync engine instead of an agent orchestrator.

- **2026-02-10: 028 Phase 1 promoted to v0.3.0 — Brady override**
  - **What changed:** Brady overrode my recommendation to defer Proposal 028 (GitHub-Native Team Planning) to Horizon. His directive: "go with 0.3.0. brady and shayne want this." I revised Proposal 027 to add Phase 1 as Wave 2 item 5.9 (Verbal + Kujan, 3-4h). Updated sprint totals from 28-39h to 31-43h. Updated 028 status to "Phase 1 Approved for v0.3.0 ✅". Phases 2-4 remain deferred.
  - **Why I'd recommended deferral:** v0.3.0 was scoped tight (2 waves, 28-39h) and Phase 1 depends on backlog capture (4.5, 4.6) which hadn't shipped yet. Building on unproven infrastructure felt premature.
  - **Why Brady's call is sound:** Phase 1 is pure prompt engineering (3-4h, no index.js changes), reuses proven `gh` CLI patterns from PR #2, and the backlog capture it depends on IS shipping in v0.3.0 Wave 1. The risk is minimal. The value — planning artifacts visible on GitHub — is immediately tangible. When the product owner says "ship it" and the risk profile is low, you ship it.
  - **Updated sprint scope:** v0.3.0 is now 4 bets (model selection, backlog capture, demo infra, GitHub Issue sync), 16 items across 2 waves, 31-43h estimated. Still well under v0.2.0's 55-71h.
  - **Learning:** My instinct to protect scope is right most of the time. But when the scope addition is low-risk prompt engineering with zero code changes, the deferral instinct can be too conservative. Read the risk profile, not just the item count.

- **2026-02-10: Marketing Site Architecture (Proposal 029)**
  - **Architecture decision: Jekyll on GitHub Pages with `docs/` as the source root.** The `docs/` directory already has 16+ well-structured markdown files (guide, features, scenarios, tours, sample prompts). Jekyll renders them in-place — add YAML front matter, add `_config.yml`, add `_layouts/`. No separate site directory, no content copying, no build pipeline.
  - **Key constraint: no content reproduction.** Brady's #1 priority. Every alternative (Docusaurus, VitePress, Hugo, separate `site/` dir) requires a build step that copies content to an output directory. Jekyll-in-docs is the only architecture where the source IS the output directory.
  - **Landing page decision: separate `index.md`.** `docs/README.md` serves GitHub's directory view (file listing context). `docs/index.md` serves the website (marketing context — "what is this, why should I care"). Different audiences, different content, not reproduction.
  - **GitHub Pages config: classic mode, not Actions.** Serve from `docs/` on `main`. Zero CI configuration. Jekyll builds natively. Actions workflow only needed if we later require unsupported plugins.
  - **npm shipping trade-off accepted.** Jekyll files (`_config.yml`, `_layouts/`, etc.) will ship in the npm package since `docs/**/*` is in `package.json` `files`. These are small, inert files. Not worth adding `.npmignore` rules for.
  - **Content boundary: `docs/` = public site, `team-docs/` = internal, `.ai-team/` = runtime.** Reinforces the three-tier separation established by Kobayashi.
  - **Phase 1 scope: 5-8 hours.** Front matter on 16 files, `_config.yml`, layouts, includes, landing page, CSS. Assigned to McManus (content/design) + Fenster (Jekyll infrastructure). No product code changes.
  - **Key file paths:** Proposal at `team-docs/proposals/029-marketing-site.md`. Decision at `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/keaton-marketing-site-architecture.md`.
