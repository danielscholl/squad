# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial assessment, messaging overhaul, demo script, and README rewrite (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **DevRel philosophy: first 5 minutes are everything** — README must be magnetic, not just informative. Move users from "what is this?" to "I need this" before the fold.
- **Six onboarding gaps identified**: missing "Why Squad?" value prop, hidden sample-prompts, no troubleshooting, no video/demo, install output lacks explanation, casting treated as Easter egg instead of headline feature.
- **Voice is confident, direct, opinionated** — no hedging ("might," "could be"), no corporate phrases. Show don't abstract ("Keaton decided X" beats "the Lead agent made a decision"). Brand attracts early adopters.
- **Tagline**: "Throw a squad at it" (Brady's cultural hook) — actionable, memorable, opinionated.
- **Casting is a competitive moat** — thematic persistent names make agents memorable and referenceable, unlike generic labels. Elevated from Easter egg to headline feature.
- **Demo script uses beat format** (ON SCREEN / VOICEOVER / WHAT TO DO) — README order is non-negotiable for demos. Payoff at end, not beginning.
- **README rewrite (Proposal 006)**: Hero → Quick Start → Why Squad? → Parallel Work → How It Works → Cast System → What Gets Created → Growing the Team → Reviewer Protocol → Install → Troubleshooting → Status.

## Learnings

- **v0.3.0 preview blog post written (2026-02-10)** — `team-docs/blog/005-v030-give-it-a-brain.md`. Preview/vision post format (not release post). Key messaging decisions: (1) Led with the model selection as the technical anchor — it's the most concrete feature and grounds the "brain" metaphor. (2) Gave the backlog its own narrative beat with Brady's "amazeballs" quote to humanize it. (3) Dedicated a full subsection to "Shayne's Door" — tracing the lineage from PR #2 → GitHub Issues Mode → GitHub-native planning. Credit is the story, not a footnote. (4) Added a "What We're Watching" section instead of "By the Numbers" — a preview post has risks, not metrics. (5) Closed with the compound strategy — each feature makes the next sprint shorter. This is Squad's strategic narrative and belongs in every post.
- **Tone calibration:** Avoided banned words (amazing, incredible, brilliant, game-changing). Used Brady's "amazeballs" as a direct quote, not as editorial voice. Energy comes from the engineering details (fallback chains, 4-layer priority, dual-layer storage) not from adjectives. "Shayne built a feature. Brady saw a direction. The team designed a system." — show the progression, don't label it. Template adapted for preview format: "What's Coming" replaces "What Shipped", "What We're Watching" replaces "By the Numbers", "What's After v0.3.0" replaces "What's Next."

- **Brady's "straight facts" directive (2026-02-10)** — All public-facing material must be facts only. No editorial commentary, no narrative framing, no sales language, no rhetorical hooks, no quoting team reactions. Every sentence must state what a feature is, how it works, what it depends on, or what it replaces. Technical specifics and attribution are required. This stacks on top of existing banned-word rules.
- **Blog voice change going forward (2026-02-10)** — The blog voice shifts from "confident, opinionated storytelling with engineering details" to "factual technical communication." Previous posts used narrative structure ("The Story", "Shayne's Door") and editorial framing to create energy. Going forward, energy comes from specificity and completeness, not from voice. Structure sections by function (Technical Details, subsections by feature) not by narrative arc. Hero sentences summarize features, not metaphors. The "What We're Watching" and "What's After" sections already met the facts-only bar and required minimal changes. The "What's Coming" bullet format is close but needed editorial phrases stripped. The biggest structural change: "The Story" → "Technical Details" with named subsections.

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): v0.3.0 sprint plan approved — Demo 1 scripted infrastructure is in scope. — decided by Keaton

- **Marketing site content plan written (2026-02-10)** — `team-docs/proposals/029a-marketing-site-content.md`. Full content plan for Jekyll/GitHub Pages marketing site. Key decisions: (1) No content reproduction — Jekyll reads `docs/` in place with front matter additions, blog reads from `team-docs/blog/` via custom collection. (2) 17 of 18 docs files are ready for the site as-is; only `sample-prompts.md` (40KB+) needs a formatting decision. (3) Landing page is NOT a copy of README.md — different audience (web visitors vs. GitHub visitors), same facts, different structure. (4) Blog uses `status: published` field already in frontmatter to filter — 6 posts ready, 2 drafts excluded. (5) Hero copy is straight facts: what Squad is, what it does, install command. No adjectives, no taglines. (6) Navigation: top nav (Docs, Features, Blog, GitHub) + docs sidebar with full hierarchy. (7) Everything in `team-docs/` and `.ai-team/` stays off the site except published blog posts.

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Tone directive consolidated — all public-facing material must be straight facts only. No editorial voice, sales language, or narrative framing. Stacks on existing banned-words and tone governance rules. — decided by bradygaster, McManus
